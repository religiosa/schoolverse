# Schoolverse

This is a VERY quick project done for a SPED course.

The code is based on Figma Make AI tools. The quality of the code is quite horrible ATM as the project was meant to be only a quick prototype for the University course. The main idea in the course was to generate ideas and solve problems related to school. Our viewpoint was teaching and instructing. The problem we wanted to solve was: "How could we utilize technology to support students who are transferring from Class 6 to Class 7?" In Finland that often means new classmates or even another school building. We wanted to make every student feel welcome at the new school and wanted to invoke a sense of belonging.

The app is a mockup of a virtual school application. The real version of the application would include students moving around in the school that is set up exactly as the real school they are transferring to. The student can build their avatar, set their hobbies and interests to tell about themselves and get to know the new school, schoolmates and teachers / other faculty. Students can complete tasks and challenges to earn coins with which they can decorate their avatar more.
